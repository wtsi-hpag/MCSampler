# MCSampler

MCSampler is an implementation of the 'Stretch-Move' algorithm for Markvo-Chain Monte Carlo sampling developed by Goodman & Weare (2010), written in a modern C++ template format for arbitrary functional analysis.

This work is heavily inspired by the Python implementation thereof, emcee, by Foreman-Mackey et. al (2013), and also makes use of the autocorrelation function Acor, also written by Goodman (https://www.math.nyu.edu/~goodman/software/acor/).
